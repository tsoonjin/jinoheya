## Goals

1. Produce something of value to people and being recognized for doing it
2. Free to experiment and explore different interests
3. Able to provide for my family a comfortable life and empower them to achieve their goals
4. Work with best of the best in the field
5. To see and experience different cultures from all over the world

## Guiding values

1. To move forward is to be willing to be a fool and to improve is to be willing to fail and fall into chaos 
2. Life is suffering. Life is about making choices and sacrifices. If you know the why,  you can live any how. The unexamined life is not worth living
3. Be brutally honest to yourself.  Let your words and actions be aligned with who you are and what you stand for. Do not live your life on autopilot
4. You are what you think and do everyday. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit. Be mindful about who and how you spend your time and energy
5. Focus, do the work patiently and hopefully everything will fall into place.
6. I do not know everything. Listen with the intent to understand. There are things and events that are out of our control. We can only control our how we think and respond to such events. Hopefully the Goddess of Luck will favor us 
7. Know yourself. Reflect and listen to your own voice. Be your own worst critic
8. Face your demon and move forward.  The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way. Be the hero that you could be
9. Be kind and forgiving to others. Everyone is dealt different hands. Make people around you a better human.
10. Strive to be what I could be. Become better than yesterday.
